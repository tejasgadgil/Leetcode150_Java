// This approach efficiently calculates the Fibonacci sequence iteratively without the need for recursion or extra space, leading to a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

// its a fibonacci sequence bascically
// bottom up approach
// Eg n = 5
//  0  1  2  3  4  5
//  8  5  3  2  1  1
// add -1 no : 2 steps to reach
// add -2 no : 1 step to reach
// eg to reach 5: 1 way is 3 (2 steps), 1 way is 4 (single step)
