class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        // Create a dummy node to handle the case where the target node is the head
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        // Initialize two pointers: dist and head
        ListNode dist = dummy;

        // Move the head pointer forward by n steps
        while (n > 0 && head != null) {
            head = head.next;
            n--;
        }

        // Move both pointers until the head pointer reaches the end of the list
        while (head != null) {
            head = head.next;
            dist = dist.next;
        }

        // Remove the nth node from the end by adjusting the next pointer of the preceding node
        dist.next = dist.next.next;
        
        // Return the head of the modified list (excluding the dummy node)
        return dummy.next;
    }
}

// This solution effectively removes the nth node from the end of the linked list using the two-pointer technique, 
// with one pointer (head) moving ahead by n steps before the second pointer (dist) starts moving. 
// The time complexity is O(L), where L is the length of the linked list, as we traverse the list only once. 
// The space complexity is O(1) since we use constant extra space.
